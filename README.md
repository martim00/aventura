# aventura

A game engine for making adventure games.

Heavily inspired by AGS (http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/) but with a focus on the web.

The engine is made on top of phaser.js (http://phaser.io/).

The editor is made with angularjs and nodewebkit (http://nwjs.io/)

I'm streaming periodically at livecoding.tv (https://www.livecoding.tv/martim00/). Come and see me doing this engine and listen to good music.
